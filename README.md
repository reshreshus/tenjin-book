Tenjin Book
=== 
An awesome flashcards (spaced repetition) and note taking app (not yet).  
You can find a *demo* version at [jinbook.org](https://jinbook.org) (only for desktop browsers).  
It is kinda slow but optimizations are possible and I want to make a proper desktop application.  

#### What I wanted to see from flashcards applications
* Free
* Security
* Open Source
* Possibility to use it in all (or most) operating systems and devices.
* Rich plugin system.
* Custom spaced repetition algorithms
* Possibility to switch to and from other SM applications easily

And I have motivation to build something like that, so stay tuned)
You can DM me in telegram ([@selopenapela](https://t.me/selopenapela)) if you have any questions.

#### The app draws inspiration from 
* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
* Supermemo
* [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/)
* [vimflowy](https://vimflowy.netlify.com/).

Work in progress!
